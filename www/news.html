                    <p>
                        "Police First is designed to attract top-class graduates into the police service.
                        Modelled on the highly successful Teach First, which is now the largest graduate
                        employer in the country, Police First will seek to improve the calibre of the cadre
                        of police officers. The truth about teaching applies also to policing - the single
                        most important factor in the quality of the service is the quality of the recruits.
                        Police recruitment has always been too narrow and has long needed to be opened up.
                        Police First will be a welcome addition to that process."
