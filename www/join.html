                        This is a two-year leadership development programme where only the very best graduates need apply.

                        You'll spend two years on the policing frontline facing some of the toughest challenges London has
                        to offer. After two years on the programme you'll have the opportunity to continue developing your
                        career within policing or the opportunity to move on to something different - perhaps with one of
                        our partner organisations.

                        Outstanding police officers can transform communities - reducing crime, increasing the public's
                        confidence in policing and improving the life chances of those living in the most deprived
                        communities. In short, great police officers can change lives.

                        But policing needs to change - we need to bring more innovation into policing; we need to change
                        the culture of policing; and we need to ensure that the police service truly reflects the public
                        that it serves. Could you be part of the change?
