                <h1>About us</h1>

                <p>
                    Police First was formed as a direct outcome from efforts bty the 
                    <a href="https://www.policecoders.org/c-100" target="_blank">Commissioner's 100</a> - 
                    a movement for change within the <a href="https://www.met.police.uk/" target="_blank">Metropolitan Police Service</a>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>So, what's the Commissioner's 100?</b>
                    The C100 is a movement of frontline police officers and staff who wanted to harness the energy and
                    spirit of frontline officers for good - they all wanted to improve policing from the bottom up
                    rather than just the top down.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Every month frontline officers and staff would hold events, to which everyone from the Commissioner
                    and Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Constabulary right down to new recruits were invited. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    One of the ideas that came out of the Commissioner's 100 was Police First. Proposed by <b>Dave Spencer</b>
                    and <b>Tor Garnett</b>, two Inspectors from East London, we believed that we could transform policing by
                    attracting the very best graduates onto the policing frontline. Since then we've been working hard
                    to make Police First a reality.
