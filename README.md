# police-first-archive

This is an archive of the original Police First website - assembled by [Police Rewired](https://policerewired.org) volunteers in 2014 as the organisation was being formed.

**View this site here: [Police First](https://policerewired.github.io/police-first-archive/)**

Police First eventually became [Police Now](https://www.policenow.org.uk/), a registered charity in England and Wales.

> Police Now’s mission is to transform communities, reduce crime and anti-social behaviour, and increase the public’s confidence in the police service by recruiting, developing and inspiring outstanding and diverse individuals to be leaders in society and on the policing frontline.
